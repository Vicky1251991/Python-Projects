This project is about Dicision Review System(DRS) in cricket.

DRS:The Decision Review System is a technology-based system used in cricket to assist the match officials with 
    their decision-making.On-field umpires may choose to consult with the third umpire, and players may request
    that the third umpire consider a decision of the on-field umpires.

            see the footage in slow motion and will find out weather the decision given 
            by on-field umpire is right or not.
