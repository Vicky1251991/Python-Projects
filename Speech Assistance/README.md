This project is about Speech Assistance.

Description:In this project we can create our own speech assistance.Which will talk to us 
            asking for the command and we will reply back to it through a microphone.We 
            can search for songs,videos,jokes,etc.. we want to.For that we just have to 
            tell our speech assistance and it will automate it for us.

Steps to RUN:
1.Run the program.
2.It will show listening... in the terminal.
3.We will speak through a microphone.
4.We will start our every sentence with the word 'alexa'.
5.To play anything from youtube we will frame our sentence as such it should contain the
  word 'play' in it.
6.To check the current time we will frame our sentence as such it should contain the word
  'time'in it.
7.To check the current date we will frame our sentence as such it should contain the word 
  'time'in it.
8.To serch about someting or someone we will frame our sentence as such it should contain
  the words 'who is' in it.
9.To listen a joke we will frame our sentence as such it should contain the word 'joke'
  in it.
10.At last alexa will ask you if you want to continue and if you again speak as 
   mentioned in above then the loop will start again.

Thank You
